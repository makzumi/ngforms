## Simple Form Generator - AngularJS / Bootstrap

**Base:(not required)** This is used for when you're using an array, view model, or have nested properties. i.e. _vm.user.first, vm.user.last, ..._

**Models:** These are your object's properties...

**Columns:** Well, the amount of colums your forms will have.

_NOTE:_ This only creates the form field structure, nothing fancy for now... maybe in the future
